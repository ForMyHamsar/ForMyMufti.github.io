    <p>1. Because despite the distance between us, you never fail to make me feel loved, appreciated and respected. </p>
    <p>2. Because of the tens of times we exchange the words "I love you" in a single day.</p>
    <p>3. Because you are empathetic and understanding.</p>
    <p>4. Because you are warm-hearted, generous, thougtful and most importantly kind.</p>
    <p>5. Because since the day I met you, I began to dream about my future <em>with <u><b>YOU</b></u></em>.</p>
    <p>6. Because I love how you don’t wear a mask and keep it real with me.</p>
    <p>7. Because I love how you inspire me to be more than I am.</p>
    <p>8. Because I love how we can be weird and silly together wether by making jokes or calling each other silly names.</p>
    <p>9. Because I love how happy you make me feel even at my worst of days.</p>
    <p>10. Because you're always so damn handsome meri mufti.</p>
